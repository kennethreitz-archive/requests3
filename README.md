Behold, the power of Requests III:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> from requests import HTTPSession

# Make a connection pool.
>>> http = HTTPSession()

# Make a request.
>>> r = http.request('get', 'https://httpbin.org/ip')
>>> r.json()
{'ip': '172.69.48.124'}

Requests III allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2 requests,
without the need for manual thought-labor. There's no need to add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, as well.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over ~1.6 million
installations *per day*!
